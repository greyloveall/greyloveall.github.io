  Project review for HIST 4261/5261: Working With Data
---

This is my project review. It was written on {{ page.date }} and falls under the category of: {{ page.category }}.

##introduction
This is the intro to **my assignment**

To be honest, at the beginning I was a bit at a loss. So I used ChatGPT to conduct a brainstorming discussion and came up with a theme that met the requirements and was in line with my personal interests. I plan to review the historical price trends of classic JDM models and analyze whether the recent significant increase in JDM model prices represents a market bubble phenomenon. This research will utilize auction data and used car market prices to explore the influence of key factors such as laws and regulations and popular culture.
